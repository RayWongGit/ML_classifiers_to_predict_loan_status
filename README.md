## About this project
This project is the assignment of the [Machine Learning with Python course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) from the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

## What do we do in this project

In this project, we build different classifiers to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

The dataset is a historical dataset from previous loan applications, 
in this project we clean the data, and apply the following different classification algorithm on the data:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

Then we find out the best parameters for each classifier and evaluate the classifiers with a test dataset.

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, Evaluation metrics including the following:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoss
